# Advent of Code 2023
Once more unto the breach.

Another year, and Python again!

## Day 1
No easy start this year, had a heck of a time catching the overlapping strings. I assumed that once a word-digit is detected those characters are invalidated for potentially overlapping words. That was not the case.

### Regex
I also decided to see if I could use regex to solve this, I cheated a little by using a third party regex lib, but then again I have better things to do with my life that figure out lookahead logic with regex.

## Day 2
Is it premature to break out some classes for this? This was a nice and easy one, or at least I was lucky enough with my initial approach that it was a trivial addition to get part 2.
